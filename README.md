# Data Science and Data Analysis Jobs Market Analysis

This project involves analyzing a job market dataset using PostgreSQL, with a specific focus on data science and data analysis roles. The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends related to job demand, salary ranges, and other relevant metrics for these roles.

Analysis Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the current demand for data science and data analysis jobs, identify salary trends, and highlight key skills required in these roles. This information is crucial for professionals in the field, job seekers, and organizations aiming to attract top talent.

Data Processing
The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL, where I employed SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate data related to job postings. Key metrics such as job demand, salary distribution, and required skills were analyzed to provide a comprehensive view of the data science and data analysis job market.
